<h2>About this project</h2>
In this project, we implemented a hotel reservation system platform. So we designed a web application for Star Hotel under sub-functions of user management, room management, taxi request management, and payment management. In this application, there are 3 main roles.  hotel admin, customer, system admin. Customers can log in to the system and can view rooms and suites available in the hotel, then can make reservations and can make pre-payments or pay at property according to the package they select. In addition to that can request a taxi. After successful login, hotel admin can add, edit, delete hotel details, view taxi requests, and send emails. System Admin carries out add, edit, delete user management function. To avoid date clashing, hotel admin can update the availability status of rooms and suits. All availability statuses can be viewed by customers.  For the payment we have added stripe as payment gateway, to get location we used google map api, sms sending done using telesignSDK, and emaijs is used to send emails to customers about appointment confirmations.
